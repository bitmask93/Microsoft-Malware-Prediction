# Microsoft Malware Prediction

## Objective :
Objective is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. This is a binary Classification Problem.

## Dataset :
Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv.

The Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle :  [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data) 

## Performance Metric :

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed label. Here we are using AUC_ROC curve because in this case, we care about both the classes equally. Besides, the dataset is Balanced as well.

## EDA and Data Cleaning :

The Train Dataset is huge ~4GB and if we try to load the entire dataset as it is, it will lead to memory error. So we need to reduce the memory size by doing the following :
- Convert objects into categories

- 64 bits encoding are all switched to 32, or 16.

- Binary values are switched to int8

- Binary values with missing values are switched to float16 (int does not understand nan) 

**Handling Missing Values :**  The dataset consists of many missing values, so I removed those features which consists of high number of missing values. The following features were dropped from the original dataset :

[DefaultBrowsersIdentifier, PuaMode, Census_ProcessorClass, Census_IsFlightingInternal , Census_InternalBatteryType , Census_IsFlightsDisabled , Census_ThresholdOptIn, Census_InternalBatteryNumberOfCharges , Census_IsWIMBootEnabled , ProductName,OrganizationIdentifier]

Now for rest of the missing features : 

- For numerical features  : [Census_InternalPrimaryDiagonalDisplaySizeInInches, Census_PrimaryDiskTotalCapacity, Census_ProcessorCoreCount, Census_SystemVolumeTotalCapacity, Census_TotalPhysicalRAM], missing values were imputed with (-1)

- For the Binary Features : [Census_HasOpticalDiskDrive, Census_IsAlwaysOnAlwaysConnectedCapable, Census_IsPenCapable, Census_IsPortableOperatingSystem, Census_IsSecureBootEnabled, Census_IsTouchEnabled, Census_IsVirtualDevice, Firewall, HasTpm, IsProtected, IsSxsPassiveMode, SMode, Wdft_IsGamer] imputed missing values with  mode of the  feature.

- For Rest of the Categorical Features, imputed missing values with a separate category : "unknown"
